Function calling is great in theory, but the JSON formatting is unreliable and more importantly, the model doesn't reason in JSON space! On the other hand, LLMs are very good at reasoning about code, and reliably adhering to syntax. The other benefit of code generation is error handling. Unlike with function calling, we can automatically run the code, check for errors, and feed the errors back to ChatGPT so it can fix the original code.

We're currently working on some more advanced applications of code generation, so we'll be updating this section often
